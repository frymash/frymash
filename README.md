  <h1><code>hey there, i'm isaac ðŸ‘‰ðŸ˜ŽðŸ‘‰</code></h1>
  <p>I've just completed my National Service and will be matriculating into university in 2023 (no prizes for guessing what I'll be majoring in).</p>
  <p>In the meantime, I've been working on a few MOOCs to tide the time. As of now, a large chunk of my GitHub's content consists of the work I've done for these courses.</p>
